There are times, after a long, long day at work that coming home and tucking into a warm cozy soup, will be one of the best feelings. It really that never gets old. Dipping bread and slowly enjoying every flavor of your food. Why should you spend 1 hour cooking this roast tomato soup? I think you’re starting to have an idea why.

I have to be honest here. I do love tomato, but tomato soup has never been my cup of tea. But it’s one of Andy’s all time favourites, so decided to have a go making it myself at home and now I’m hooked. Roasted tomato soup is like sunshine in a bowl, especially pairing it with grilled cheese (either normal cheese or vegan cheese). There is something about that natural perfect amount of the tanginess and saltiness of the roasted tomato soup, that can brighten up your dull day. The secret is you can cook this roast tomato soup in bulk and freeze it, so you can enjoy this bowl of happiness whenever you want.

Other than being absolutely light, delicious and completely different to regular creamy soup, Roast tomato soup is also a perfect beauty elixir. It’s great for a healthy heart and is full of antioxidants. From the recipe I’ve posted before [Rainbow Soba Noodle Salad](../rainbow-noodle-salad), we’ve talked about how colour indicates the benefits in vegetables. Red in tomato indicates lots and lots of healthy benefits. High in vitamins (A,C and K), iron. My favourite ones are lycopene and beta-carotene which help your skin to glow, keep you strong against cancer and aging. Cooking tomatoes also helps to increase these benefits by 35%!! So what are you waiting for?? Let’s get cooking!

- Blend finely and add back into the pot (if you don’t used the immersion blender)
- When you blend the soup, slowly drizzle 1 tbsp of olive oil in to give the soup a more silky texture (This is totally optional)
- Flavor to taste with salt and pepper if needed.

###### Tips:
- If you want thicker soup without adding any cream. Add a slice or two of soft bread (no crust) and blend in with the soup instead of cream.
- You don’t need to remove the tomato skin if you want to keep all the extra nutrients they give. But if you prefer a smoother result than better remove the skin.
- When you face down all ingredients before roasting is to help.
- You can use any kinds of tomato, the fresher the better.
