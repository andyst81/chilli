These little tiny seeds are one of the best superfoods. Completely full of antioxidants, they  contain more calcium than milk, more omega-3 fatty acid than salmon, which helps to increase HDL, the good cholesterol that protects us from heart attacks. What surprised me most is that Chia seeds are 20% protein. Lastly the seeds are high in fiber (37%) which helps us feel full longer and helps promote weight loss. A glass of our chia seed breakfast pudding and strawberry smoothie can help boost your digestive system to the max.

In terms of texture, they are a little unusual. You might need to get used to them a bit. Before consuming you’ll need to soak them in water, or any liquid, for at least 30 minutes (overnight is better!). When you see them swell up into a fluffy jelly texture, you’ll know they’re ready. You can have Chia pudding by itself without the smoothie as well, just add in some plant milk and leave them to fluff up. Because Chia seeds themselves don’t have much taste, adding a bit of natural sweetener and some aroma can vamp up the flavor by miles. Most people will eat the pudding with fresh or dried fruits.

The reason I love chia seed breakfast pudding and strawberry smoothie so much is that perfect sweet and tangy combination of flavors that can satisfy my sweet tooth as well as being healthy. You really don’t have to sacrifice the flavor when you want to be healthy at all. I also love to top it with granola for extra crunch. There are many other recipes made from Chia seeds that I want to share with you guys. For now please enjoy and hope you all have another happy healthy meal.

P.S. You can eat Chia seeds raw by sprinkling them on top of food, but it’s better to soak them first to release the enzyme inhibitor and not take away the water from your body during the day. The daily recommendation Chia seed consumption is no more than 2 tablespoons due to the high fiber content.
