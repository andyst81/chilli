Pad Thai is one of the most well known dishes in Thailand. The famous taste is sour, sweet, spicy and saucy all surrounding chewy rice noodle. Traditionally one of the most important ingredients other than tamarind and palm sugar is fish sauce, but today we’re making it vegetarian. It can also be vegan friendly (just leave out the egg). We’ll substitute the fish sauce with thin soy sauce and salt instead. Cook this vegetarian pad thai recipe for your friends and dazzle them with your cooking skills.

It’s very important to choose thin soy sauce for this recipe, not soy sauce. The main difference, other than colour, is that thin soy sauce has a lighter flavour with a hint of sweetness. The smell won’t overpower the tamarind and palm sugar which is should be quite potent in authentic pad thai. You should be able to buy pad thai sauce in any good Asian supermarket, but it’s not too difficult to make your own sauce. Click here to see the recipe for my aromatic pad thai sauce. If you’d like to make your it yourself, make quite a big batch as the sauce can be kept in the fridge for up to 2 months – trust me you’re going to want to make this dish again and again.
