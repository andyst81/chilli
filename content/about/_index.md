Sawasdee ka, my name is Mina, I run this blog along with my husband Andy. I’m the cook, blogger and photographer behind Chilli and Lime. I was born and raised in Thailand. I’ve learned and loved cooking Thai food from scratch from a very young age and with a full passion. Since I became an adult, I’ve started to learn more and more recipes from around the world. For photography I’ve just started, so there are still so much room to improve and learn, but I love every single bit of it. Andy started learning to code a few years ago and inspired me to create this blog. I’m very lucky to have my own personal web support, developer, proofreader and occasional cook to help me. He’s also planning to have his own blog, it’s going to be so awesome!

We believe that healthy food doesn’t have to be boring and doesn’t have to be difficult to make. You really don’t need to sacrifice fantastic flavor when you’re trying to eat healthily. This is the reason why we started Chilli and Lime together.

Being an interracial couple who is passionate about food and cooking, Andy and I also love to create our own recipes, both Thai, international and fusion that we would be more than happy to share it to all of you. Hope you will enjoy our healthy recipes with an edge. Let us help brighten up your day with full-flavor good grub and many more pick-you-up recipes, kitchen tips and tricks, lifestyle, travel and many more are coming soon.

>For now…let’s spice it up!
