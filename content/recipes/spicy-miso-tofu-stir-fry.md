Tofu or bean curd is traditionally made from soybeans. Many people don’t like the taste or texture of tofu much, probably because, on it’s own, it doesn’t have much taste. It also has a springy, chewy texture, but is it really that bad? Not at all. In fact, if we consider tofu to be a blank canvas, we can jazz it up with seasonings and a delicious, delicious umami vibe. For this spicy tofu dish, I chose miso to add a nice saltiness and sriracha sauce to add some heat and tanginess.

Tofu is a well known alternative for protein for everybody – especially vegetarians and vegan. You can add some chewy or crispy texture to your meal without adding extra calories. It’s also totally affordable!

- As well as the stir fry process, you can also use a couple tsp. of water to help cooking the garlic and the veg.
- If you don’t like it spicy you can remove the seeds from the chillis or even leave them out completely.
- Please be careful if you use chilli in any stir fry, it’ll make you cough, so make sure you have a ventilator on or have a window open.
- Make sure you have all the ingredients to hand when cooking as the stir fry cooks VERY fast.
