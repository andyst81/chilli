>#### Thai Sriracha Chilli Sauce Recipe

- **Prep Time**: 20 mins
- **Cook Time**: 40 mins
- **Total Time**: 1 hour
- **Portions**: Fills four 250ml bottles

###### You’ll need:
- Red bird’s eye chili 50g. (20 chillies)
- Big yellow chilli 200g. (15-16 chillies)
- Red spur chilli 300g. (20 chillies)
- Ripe tomatoes 5-6 large ones
- Garlic 12-15 cloves
- Yellow onion 2 large ones
- Sea salt 4-5 tsp. (adjustable)
- Brown sugar 4.5 tps.
- White wine vinegar 2 cups (white vinegar works too!)
- Olive oil 2 tsp.
- Water 1.5 cup (adjustable)
###### Let’s start!
- Roughly chop all chillies and place them into food processor along with onion and garlic. Add a generous pinch of salt and blend it finely. Put it in a bowl and set aside.
- In the same food processor, roughly chop all tomatoes and again blend it finely
- Put a medium sized wok or pan on medium heat and add olive oil. Add the chilli mixture, add another pinch of salt, brown sugar and vinegar. Reduce the heat to a simmer for 10-15 mins until most of the water has evaporated.
- Add blended tomato in the chillies mixture, stir a bit and let it simmer for another 20-30 minutes.
- If the sauce starts to dry up in the first 10-15 mins, add a bit of water.
- Turn off the heat, let the sauce cool down or blend it straight away carefully, depending on your blender type.
- Strain it through a sieve, making sure you don’t leave a single delicious drop of this Sriracha chilli sauce behind, or enjoy it rustic way.
- Enjoy!
###### Tips:
-  If you are concerned about the amount of sodium in the sauce, you can adjust the amount according to your taste.
- Pasteurize the bottles and everything that will touch the final chilli sauce in hot water before bottling, the sauce can be kept for several months in the refrigerator.
- If you’d like to use white sugar, you might need to reduce the amount and taste as you go cause white sugar is sweeter.
- If you can take the heat, you can also add more bird’s eye chillies as you like.
- Caution, when blending hot liquids, don’t overfill your blender, please leave a small opening to allow heat to escape.
