The best green smoothie should combine 70%-80% vegetables and 20%-30% fruits and others. This way your smoothie will be full of nutrients instead of sugar. If you’re a beginner. I’d recommended start little by little. I first start with handful of spinach with loads of frozen fruits, plant milk and even add a splash of sweetener. You can decrease the amount of sweetener as you get more used to the flavour. You will be surprised how your taste buds adjust over time. In terms of liquid, you can add anything from juice, plant milk or even just water. Then if you have any extra superfoods to add in  (Maca, Chia seeds, Spirulina powder, Chlorella powder, hemp seed, flax seeds, etc.).

One quick tip here – if you have trouble consuming the vegan green smoothie cause of the veggies smell, try add a little knob of ginger, lemon or lime to freshen it up. Oh! And if you use very ripe bananas, you won’t need to add any extra sweetener as ripe bananas are naturally very sweet. This recipe is perfect for the green smoothie beginner. Be healthy and enjoy!
