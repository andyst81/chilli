I’m a strong believer that you have to get healthy to lose weight and the best way to keep all of the unwanted weight off is to change your lifestyle - both mentally and physically. If you are one of the people who is trying all your life to lose weight or you are just looking for some healthy recipes, I’ll be your best supporter.\nOn this website, you can find healthy keto, low carb, vegetarian, vegan and asian recipes with a twist. I think no diet is better than others. The best one is the one that makes you feel your best and can keep up with your day to day lifestyle.\nI started my health journey about 5 years ago when I decided to become vegetarian/vegan. I followed a high carb low fat veggie diet for almost 3 years. I did lose weight and yes it’s very healthy, but it didn’t help me lose weight in the way I wanted it to and I found that it was too difficult sometimes to stick with the lifestyle. So one day one of my friends said he is going to try a ketogenic diet (which is a high fat low carb diet). Then all of my friends started the same diet and my new journey began again until now almost 1 year. In that year, I’ve lost 20 kg. And I’m still going. I’m really happy with this lifestyle and hope to keep going and if not I’ll just easily move to low carb instead. I feel that’s very doable.\nHere is my before and after picture within the first 7 months. I haven’t stopped yet! I’d like to be one of your guides to ease out your journey.

With the high amount of fat and grease, I can’t help but feeling sick and heavy afterward.\nSo, after discovering vegan version of mac and cheese. To confess I was quite skeptical about the recipe at first, but then since I’m trying to decrease dairy consumption as much as I can, so why not?

Many people have a funny feeling about mixing greens and fruits, but I’ve got just the tip for you here.\nBefore you give up the idea, here are some benefits: This vegan green smoothie is the perfect way to increase your veg and fruit intake. You can let your digestive system rest while your body fully absorbs all the nutrients which help boost your energy, full of antioxidants, promoting weight loss, leaving you with a healthy body, glowing skin and make you crave more every morning.\nThe best green smoothie should combine 70%-80% vegetables and 20%-30% fruits and others. This way your smoothie will be full of nutrients instead of sugar. If you’re a beginner. I’d recommended start little by little. I first start with handful of spinach with loads of frozen fruits, plant milk and even add a splash of sweetener. You can decrease the amount of sweetener as you get more used to the flavour. You will be surprised how your taste buds adjust over time. In terms of liquid, you can add anything from juice, plant milk or even just water. Then if you have any extra superfoods to add in (Maca, Chia seeds, Spirulina powder, Chlorella powder, hemp seed, flax seeds, etc.).\nOne quick tip here – if you have trouble consuming the vegan green smoothie cause of the veggies smell, try add a little knob of ginger, lemon or lime to freshen it up.

Completely full of antioxidants, they contain more calcium than milk, more omega-3 fatty acid than salmon, which helps to increase HDL, the good cholesterol that protects us from heart attacks. What surprised me most is that Chia seeds are 20% protein. Lastly the seeds are high in fiber (37%) which helps us feel full longer and helps promote weight loss. A glass of our chia seed breakfast pudding and strawberry smoothie can help boost your digestive system to the max.\nIn terms of texture, they are a little unusual. You might need to get used to them a bit. Before consuming you’ll need to soak them in water, or any liquid, for at least 30 minutes (overnight is better!). When you see them swell up into a fluffy jelly texture, you’ll know they’re ready. You can have Chia pudding by itself without the smoothie as well, just add in some plant milk and leave them to fluff up. Because Chia seeds themselves don’t have much taste, adding a bit of natural sweetener and some aroma can vamp up the flavor by miles. Most people will eat the pudding with fresh or dried fruits.\nThe reason I love chia seed breakfast pudding and strawberry smoothie so much is that perfect sweet and tangy combination of flavors that can satisfy my sweet tooth as well as being healthy. You really don’t have to sacrifice the flavor when you want to be healthy at all. I also love to top it with granola for extra crunch. There are many other recipes made from Chia seeds that I want to share with you guys. For now please enjoy and hope you all have another happy healthy meal.\nP.S. You can eat Chia seeds raw by sprinkling them on top of food, but it’s better to soak them first to release the enzyme inhibitor and not take away the water from your body during the day. The daily recommendation Chia seed consumption is no more than 2 tablespoons due to the high fiber content.\n Chia Pudding and Strawberry Smoothie Recipe   Prep Time: 10 mins Cook Time: 5 mins Total Time: 15 mins Portions: 2 portions  You’ll need: For the chia pudding\n 2 tbsp. Chia seeds 1 cup Plant milk (approx) 1 tbsp Agave nectar or any liquid sweetener ½ tsp. Vanilla extract  For the strawberry smoothie\n 2 Frozen bananas 8-10 Small frozen strawberries ½ cup Walnut milk (or any plant milk) 1 tsp. Maca powder (optional) 1 tbsp. Agave nectar (or any liquid sweetener) Quarter cup of water Extra fresh strawberries or other fruits and a spoonful of granola to garnish  Let’s start!  Add chia and all the chia pudding ingredients in a bowl or any container with lid. Stir to combine Put this in the fridge and leave overnight – or at least 30 minutes before consuming. Add all the smoothie ingredients in the blender and blend until smooth. Once the chia pudding has set, add it to the serving glass and top with the strawberry smoothie.

They can be a great source of potassium, protein and selenium. They’re also a good source of phosphorus, zinc, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin C, folic acid, niacin, vitamins B-1 and B-2 and the list go on. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of different types of edible mushroom and they all have slightly different nutritional benefits. I chose to use King oyster mushroom for this grilled mushrooms recipe, cause its bouncy, chewy texture goes perfectly with the black pepper sauce. You can also try this recipe with many other mushroom.\nJust because you are no longer eating meat doesn’t mean you can’t have fun and enjoy a summer barbecue. This grilled mushrooms and black pepper sauce recipe is equally great for either mushroom lovers or pairing with other meals as a side dish.

Fresh cracked black pepper 1 tbsp.

Put the mushrooms in the bowl then add the vegetable oil and toss until lightly coated. Add all mushroom to the skewer.  Let’s start!  Add all the marinade ingredients in a bowl stir to combine then set aside. I choose to grill it on the griddle pan. But you can grill it directly on the barbecue. Try to keep an eye on them as they can cook quite quickly. We are going to cook it half way around 5-7 minutes(the mushroom will starting get smaller in size) then brush the sauce on both sides as the mushrooms are grilling. Grill until charred and cooked. Garnish with the toasted sesame.  Tips:  Served with our Jaw (Thai spicy sauce) for the optimum flavor.Enjoy!

It really that never gets old. Dipping bread and slowly enjoying every flavor of your food. Why should you spend 1 hour cooking this roast tomato soup? I think you’re starting to have an idea why.\nI have to be honest here. I do love tomato, but tomato soup has never been my cup of tea. But it’s one of Andy’s all time favourites, so decided to have a go making it myself at home and now I’m hooked. Roasted tomato soup is like sunshine in a bowl, especially pairing it with grilled cheese (either normal cheese or vegan cheese). There is something about that natural perfect amount of the tanginess and saltiness of the roasted tomato soup, that can brighten up your dull day. The secret is you can cook this roast tomato soup in bulk and freeze it, so you can enjoy this bowl of happiness whenever you want.\nOther than being absolutely light, delicious and completely different to regular creamy soup, Roast tomato soup is also a perfect beauty elixir. It’s great for a healthy heart and is full of antioxidants. From the recipe I’ve posted before Rainbow Soba Noodle Salad, we’ve talked about how colour indicates the benefits in vegetables. Red in tomato indicates lots and lots of healthy benefits. High in vitamins (A,C and K), iron. My favourite ones are lycopene and beta-carotene which help your skin to glow, keep you strong against cancer and aging. Cooking tomatoes also helps to increase these benefits by 35%!! So what are you waiting for?? Let’s get cooking!\n Roast Tomato Soup Recipe   Prep Time: 10 mins Cook Time: 50 mins Total Time: 1 hour Portions: 4 portions  You’ll need:  1 kg. ripe Beefsteak tomatoes 8-10 Cherry tomatoes 1 Bulb garlic 1 Big red onion 1 Big Yellow onion Handful of Italian basil 1-2 tsp. Salt and pepper to spring over the tomato (before roasted) 1 ½ tsp. Salt and pepper to taste (I used a couple of pinches) 2-3 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil ½ Tsp. Balsamic vinegar (optional) 250 ml. Filtered water  Let’s start!  Let’s start! Wash and dry all tomatoes. Turn on the oven at 180 degree C warm it up for 10 minutes Cut tomatoes and garlic bulb in half. Peel, wash and chop the onions into big wedges. Add them all to a heat proof tray Add 1-2 tbsp of olive oil the cover all veggies then add salt and pepper Mix all the ingredients to make sure they are all covered in oil, salt and pepper Turn all the chopped tomatoes, garlic bulb face down Pop them in the oven for 30 minutes After 30 minutes, remove the tray from the oven and let it cool down slightly. You’ll see the tomato skin start to separate from the tomato flesh. Simply removed all the skins as they cool down Squeeze all garlic out of the peel. Add all roasted ingredients (don’t forget the delicious juice!) into a large heavy bottom pot and add water. Let it simmer for 15 – 20 minutes Add Balsamic vinegar Blend finely and add back into the pot (if you don’t used the immersion blender) When you blend the soup, slowly drizzle 1 tbsp of olive oil in to give the soup a more silky texture (This is totally optional) Flavor to taste with salt and pepper if needed.  Tips:  If you want thicker soup without adding any cream. Add a slice or two of soft bread (no crust) and blend in with the soup instead of cream. You don’t need to remove the tomato skin if you want to keep all the extra nutrients they give. But if you prefer a smoother result than better remove the skin. When you face down all ingredients before roasting is to help. You can use any kinds of tomato, the fresher the better.

We often pair it with grilled meat and traditionally use fish sauce as one of the main ingredients, but as this is a vegetarian version of this Thai spicy sauce (totally vegan friendly) I’ll be using soy sauce instead.\nThe other important ingredient is “Toasted rice powder” (you can find how to make it simply by pressing here). Toasted rice powder helps thicken the sauce and also give the thai spicy sauce a distinct texture and a signature nutty aroma, so please make sure you prepare the toasted rice powder in advance.\nFor flavor in this Thai spicy sauce, we already have a salty flavour from soy sauce. We add sweetness from the sugar, for the acidic flavor, we’ll be using lime, but it’s also common to use tamarind. If you can’t find any tamarind or lime, you can also use lemon. To spice it up, we use dried chilli flakes, but if you only have fresh chillies at hand, they can also be used.\nIf you are looking for a great vegan barbecue option, check out our Grilled mushrooms with black pepper sauce recipe!\n Spicy Thai Dipping Sauce (แจ่ว) Recipe   Prep Time: 10 mins Cook Time: 5 mins Total Time: 15 mins Portions: 4 portions  You’ll need:  2-3 tbsp.

Culantro or coriander (sliced) 3-4 Red shallot (small – thinly sliced) A dash of water  Let’s start!  Add soy sauce and lime juice followed by sugar then stir til the sugar has dissolved. Adjust the flavor to your liking. Add the shallots and all the greens (spring onion, culantro). Then add chilli flake and toasted rice powder. That’s it! Simple and absolutely delicious.  Tips:  If you need to prepare the sauce in advance, better leave the herbs and toasted rice out then add it in just before you serve the sauce. This helps keep the flavor fresh, cause the rice will swell as it absorbs the liquid and the greens will wilt from the acidic lime and won’t look as appetizing.

Tum Khao Pod (ตำข้าวโพด) or Thai spicy corn salad takes a lot of influence from Isaan food, which is mostly spicy, light and generally made with fresh, natural ingredients.\nThere are many kinds of spicy salad in Thailand. The most common one is papaya salad (som tum or ส้มตำ – the recipe is coming soon!). I love that it is so fresh, light, spicy and as added bonus, low calorie and super quick to make.\nIf you order it in Thailand generally they will add dried shrimp and salted egg to it. Also, they’ll use fish sauce. In this recipe, we’ll be using thin soy sauce instead to make it completely vegan. We use thin soy sauce because it won’t overpower our Thai spicy corn salad as much as regular soy sauce, but it will still give us that umami factor. I usually have the Thai spicy corn salad as a snack, side dish or even main meal. It is delicious served with grilled mushrooms and sticky rice or even regular white rice. Just remember to serve and eat right away after you cook it for the best flavor.\n Thai Spicy Corn Salad Recipe   Prep Time: 15 mins Cook Time: 5 mins Total Time: 20 mins Portions: 2 portions  You’ll need:  1 Fresh sweet corn (medium size) 3-4 Cloves of garlic 3-4 Bird’s eye chillies ½ tbsp Palm sugar 2 tbs.

Slice and add the tomato. Lightly pound and mix up the mixture. Add lime (you can add the lime with the peel still on as it will add extra fragrance, but you can also leave it out if you prefer) Add thin soy sauce then lastly add the corn. Lightly pound and grind to combine for 2 minutes. Topped with toasted peanut or any nuts for some extra crunch.(I used toasted cashew nuts). Serve right away.  Tips:  If you don’t have a mortar and pestle. Don’t worry. You can smash the garlic and chilli with the flat side of a cooking knife. Then mix lime juice, thin soy sauce and sugar in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Pour over the corn, sliced tomatoes and long beans; toss well.

I think you have probably heard this phrase once or more times. Oh..well I know my noodle salad with spicy peanut dressing does not exactly come in 7 colours, but the idea is that combining more than one shade of fruits and vegetables in every meal can really benefit your health. The vibrant hue of all vegetables that we see is not just bright and pretty; it also indicate its own benefits.\nRed,Orange and Yellow: a red pigment is full of Lycopene which helps reduce the chance of breast and prostate cancer as well as being great for your heart and skin. Orange and yellow pigments are full of Beta carotene, packed with Vitamin C’s immune-boosting powers. You can these benefits in tomato, watermelon, beets, carrot, lemon, pumpkin, etc.\nGreen: When asked to think of vegetables, most people imagine a plate of greens. But don’t let the green colour scare you away! Lush green shades indicate tons of vitamins (A,C,K), minerals and antioxidants. A lot of people stay away from green veg because they believe the taste is bitter. If you fall into this group, it’s time to get more adventurous. Start out with green peas, young broccoli and cabbage, then when you are getting a bit more advanced, it’s time to try kale, spinach, Brussels sprouts to sample their green goodness.\nBlue, Indigo, Purple: Loads and loads of antioxidants, very high in vitamins C, helps to prevent heart disease and great for memory function. You can easily find these benefits from grapes, blueberries, eggplants and purple cabbage among other things. Do you know there are such things as purple asparagus and purple carrot? So pretty and so, so delicious.\nEven though these foods offer so many benefits and are so beautiful, there are still many people who will pull their face when it comes to eating plate full of veggies. I actually know some vegetarians who don’t really eat vegetables – how bizarre?! Ok, ok there may be scientific and psychological reasons behind it. There are some genes that make some people taste bitter or soapy flavors when they eat certain veg. As vegetables themselves don’t have much flavor or the umami factor that can kick start our taste buds, if you want to start eating more vegetables, maybe start by adding some sauces or dressing.\nIf you want a good place to start, try making this noodle salad with spicy peanut dressing. It’s salty, sour, spicy with hint of sweetness and the delicious homemade peanut butter really helps to round up the flavor between crunchy veggies and chewy soba noodles. Enjoy! Oh….plus soba themselves are made from buckwheat, so they are gluten free, low fat and high in protein!… You’re welcome.\n Rainbow Veggie Soba Noodle Salad Recipe   Prep Time: 20 mins Cook Time: 20 mins Total Time: 40 mins Portions: 2 portions  You’ll need: For the dressing\n 2.5 tbsp.

Soba noodle Cucumber (as you like) Carrot (as you like) Yellow pepper (as you like) Purple cabbage (as you like) Rocket or any greens (as you like) Sesame seeds (for garnish) Spring onion(for garnish)  Let’s start!  Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, add peanut butter and water to thin out the mixture (if your peanut butter is too hard feel free to microwave it for 30 seconds) then add the rest of the wet ingredients – soy sauce, lime juice, agave nectar stir to combine then give it a taste. Add chopped garlic, sliced chillies and sesame oil. Mix together then top with sesame seeds. Feel free to adjust the quantities of the ingredients according to your own taste. I’d recommend you to start prepare all vegetables first. Start with julienne (cut into short, thin strips) or thinly sliced vegetables of your choice. We are using 1 cucumber and 1 carrot, half a purple cabbage, half a yellow pepper and a handful of rocket leaves. Set it aside. Add the soba noodle to a medium pot of boiling water. Stir occasionally. Let simmer away for 5 – 7 minutes or according to the package instructions. Whilst the noodles are cooking, prepare a big bowl with water and ice. Add soba into the ice water to stop the cooking process then rinse them well. Then simply add all vegetables and soba noodle in a bowl then top with the dressing, mix well and garnish with sesame and spring onion. Serve your delicious noodle salad straight away.

Many people don’t like the taste or texture of tofu much, probably because, on it’s own, it doesn’t have much taste. It also has a springy, chewy texture, but is it really that bad? Not at all. In fact, if we consider tofu to be a blank canvas, we can jazz it up with seasonings and a delicious, delicious umami vibe. For this spicy tofu dish, I chose miso to add a nice saltiness and sriracha sauce to add some heat and tanginess.\n If you’re a tofu disbeliever, then let my spicy tofu stir fry change your mind (quick warning: you might want to cook this every night as it’s super delicious).\n The key to master cooking tofu is to season and cook it right. Any tofu tastes way better after marinating and frying to crispen it up and coat it with yummy spicy sauce.

You can use the non stick pan to sear the tofu (it might not get crispy, but after it’s coated in the sauce it’ll still be delicious) As well as the stir fry process, you can also use a couple tsp. of water to help cooking the garlic and the veg. If you don’t like it spicy you can remove the seeds from the chillis or even leave them out completely.

Make sure you have all the ingredients to hand when cooking as the stir fry cooks VERY fast.

Add your raw peanuts to a tray and bake it for 10-15 minutes at 180C / 350F. Remove the peanuts from the oven and put them in a food processor when they are still warm (but not too hot. I found that they cool down pretty fast – around 5 minutes). Pulse the food processor for a couple minutes til the mixture becomes grainy like sand. - Then increase the speed to medium until the mixture starting to thicken up slightly – approx. another 1-2 minutes. Add the sea salt and oil to food processor(at this point you can also add your honey or any other ingredients to flavor). Now, switch around between high and low speed until the mixture turn silky and smooth. - You might need to stop to scrape the sides down or give your food processor a rest along the way – make sure it won’t get too hot! This process should take around 2-3 minutes. Store in airtight container and keep it in the fridge to prevent the oil from getting rancid.  Tips:  This peanut butter will last around 2-3 weeks. If you prefer your peanut butter on the sweet side. You can add 2 tbsp of honey or any liquid sweetener or even melted chocolate at the same time you add salt to flavor things up! If you toast your peanut and leave it out for too long pop them in the oven for 2 minutes before you blend them. Blending the nuts while they are still warm can ease the processing. If you prefer raw nut butter, feel free to skip the oven process. In the blending process, it might seem like it’s not going to become smooth, just keep blending. After a couple minutes the mixture will get more and more runny and silky. It will them thicken up and get more solid after you put it in the fridge.  Extra Cheeky Tip:  If you buy roasted peanuts from the store, you can just warm it for 2 minutes in oven and you can probably get this done in less than 5 minutes!

In this recipe, I’d recommend Japanese Pumpkin for the smooth, light texture and a mild sweetness.\nMiso is Japanese fermented soybean paste that has a salty umami flavor which helps to elevate the flavor to another level. It is also full of probiotics which are amazing for our stomach. There are many kinds of miso available, but in this recipe we’ll be using white miso.\nLast, but one of the main ingredient I need to mention is the noodles. I’ll be using thin instant udon – which are soft, chewy and easy to find in the supermarket. You can also use ramen, soba or somen noodles.\nThis might not be the most authentic recipe, but I adapted the ingredients and measurements from many inspiring recipes to my own liking.

Cut into big wedges and peel the skin. Add to the steamer for 20 – 30 minutes or until fork tender. Remove from the steamer and let it cool down. Mash the pumpkin with a fork.  If you buy canned pumpkin puree, please sure it’s 100% pumpkin with no added sugar or spices\nPrepare the other ingredients:\n Finely chop the garlic and ginger Roughly chop the spring onion Cut mushroom into smaller chunks Wash and keep bean sprout in water til you are ready to cook them, so they won’t wilt and turn brown  Let’s start!

Cook til it is fragrant and translucent, then add pumpkin puree. Stir quickly then add mirin. Cook for 3-4 minutes then add the stock. Wait until the soup boils, then turn the heat down to simmer for 15 minutes. In a separate bowl dissolve the miso with water, then add to the soup after you’ve turned off the heat. If you add miso when the soup is still boiling, you might kill the probiotic goodness. After adding miso, it should be salty enough, but if you prefer it saltier, you can add a dash of some shoyu (soy) sauce to taste.  For the vegetables and the noodles:\n In a deep pot add water and a pinch of salt, wait til it’s boiling vigorously. Add your bean sprouts, cook until they are semi-translucent – around 4.5 minutes, remove then put them in cold water to stop the cooking process.

The Tom yum soup cooking method is quite straight forward and customizable to your taste. If you like it more sour, you can add more lime juice, like salty add more fish sauce or thin soy sauce (I don’t recommend regular soy sauce because it adds too much color and the smell is quite strong). For me, I love my tom yum soup to be sour, then salty and a little bit sweet just to round up the flavor.\nFor the creamy tom yum soup version, some people like to add evaporated milk instead of sugar, but coconut milk is a great choice for people who have lactose intolerant or vegan. If you don’t finish it in one sitting, you can separate the tom yum soup before adding the seasoning ingredients (I’ll tell you how later) and put some in the fridge for later – it will last a couple of days.\n Creamy Mushroom Tom Yum Soup (ต้มยำเห็ดน้ำข้น) Recipe   Prep Time: 10 mins Cook Time: 20 mins Total Time: 30 mins Portions: 4 portions  You’ll need:  2 handfuls of straw mushrooms * 3-5 Kaffir lime leaves 3-4 stalks of Lemongrass 1 thumb sized piece of galangal 3-10 bird’s eye chillies * A splash of coconut cream * 1.5- 2 Litre of vegetable stock (or any stock) 1 – 2 limes * 5-6 tbs of thin soy sauce or fish sauce * 1 pinch of coconut sugar 1-2 Coriander or Culantro (Saw leaf parsley) Shallots or onions (Optional) Thai chilli paste or chilli oil *  these ingredient quantities are adjustable – making tom yum is all about adjusting to find your favourite flavor.\nLet’s start!

After 10-15 minutes your mushrooms should be cooked and it’s time to start favoring. If you are going to save some soup for another day, separate it now. Add a pinch of coconut sugar and the fish sauce (thin soy sauce for vegan version). Add the chilli, turn the heat down to a simmer for 5 mins. Turn off the heat then squeeze the lime (if you add lime while the soup is boiling it’ll taste bitter)   You can put the coconut milk straight in the soup after turn off the heat then slowly dissolve the thai chilli paste in with your ladle or leave it as it is, if you can’t handle the heat.

It has an amazing flavour that starts with the fantastically aromatic pad thai sauce that we’re going to look at today. There are so many ways to cook pad thai. Making the pad thai sauce ahead can help reduce the hassle during cooking. You can also make a big batch like I did. This pad thai sauce can be kept in the fridge up to 2 months. The sauce is quite concentrated, so if you don’t like it too spicy, please leave the chilli paste or and chilli flakes from the recipe. However, the chilli paste will give fantastic smell all over your house (and your mouth hehe) and the kind of dried chillies we’re using today aren’t that spicy.\nFor pad thai sauce the flavor is supposed start with sourness from tamarind, sweetness from palm sugar. It’s also salty and a little bit spicy. I highly recommend you use palm sugar or coconut sugar as it gives the rounder sweetness rather than a very sharp sweetness that comes from refines sugars. However if you can’t find those sugars in your area, brown sugar is a capable substitute.\nIn the original recipe, fish sauce is an important ingredient that gives the sauce a salty flavor. As we are making vegetarian version, in the recipe, I used thin soy sauce _ ซีอิ๊วขาว instead. Thin soy sauce has a lighter taste with a hint of sweetness compared to normal soy sauce. If you don’t have access to thin soy sauce, regular salt will also do the trick.\nWe’ll separate this recipe into 2 parts. The chilli part is the old way of making the sauce. It gives an amazing odor and flavor to pad thai, but for faster results, you can either skip the chillies altogether or just add red chilli flakes.\n Pad Thai Sauce Recipe   Prep Time: 20 mins Cook Time: 20 mins Total Time: 40 mins Portions: 10 - 12 portions  You’ll need: Chilli paste\n ½ cup of big red chilli (can use less) 1 cup of sliced shallots ½ tsp of coarse sea salt 5 small cloves of garlic  Pad Thai sauce\n 1 cup of tamarind paste 1 cup of palm sugar ¾ cup of thin soy sauce 1 tbsp of salt ½ cup of water Chilli paste from above  Let’s start!  Make the chilli paste first. In a mortar and pestle add coarse salt to help the pounding process then add chilli, shallots and garlic. You will find it easier if you add the ingredients bit by bit. Keep pounding until all ingredients are combined, then set aside. Feel free to blend it in a blender if you don’t have mortar and pestle for faster results, however it may not be as smooth In a medium pot on low heat add the vegetable oil and chilli paste mixed. Fry until fragrant – around 10 minutes. You will see the oil float up to the surface slightly and the mixture will soften. Add tamarind sauce, palm sugar, salt and water. Stir occasionally until all the sugar has been dissolved. The sauce will be slightly translucent and somewhat thick.  Tips:  Tamarind is a kind of fruit in Thailand, it gives a subtle sourness with a slight hint of sweetness. If you buy it whole from the market soak it in warm water (not too much) for around 15 minutes then hand massage it until the water get thicker, you can strain it. There you have it! Most Asian supermarkets will have tamarind paste or tamarind sauce if you need a shortcut here. Trick for chill – cut them into small pieces and soak them in water for 10-15 minutes to soften them and make them easier to work with. You can remove the seeds to soften the spicy kick or leave them in. I removed the seeds in mine, but then I added some dried birds eye chilli for heat instead.
